# Python-Kernel-Simulator-with-Scheduler
Although Python is not typically used for developing operating systems,  this project simulates the behavior of a kernel and demonstrates how a CPU schedules processes.  It includes implementations of common scheduling algorithms and provides an educational way  to explore process management and task scheduling in operating systems.
